# Stereolabs ZED -  OpenCV Native Capture

This sample shows how to capture rectified images with the ZED or ZED-M Camera and OpenCV, without the ZED SDK.

If you want to use OpenCV with the ZED SDK features, check our sample [here](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-opencv).

## OS

- Linux, Windows, MacOS

## Requirements

Python modules :

- numpy
- cv2
- wget
- configparser

## Run the program

      python3 zed-opencv-native.py <camera_serial_number>

## Notes

- You need to know the serial number of the camera you are trying to open. To do so, you can use ZED Explorer tools (ZED SDK tools) and check the serial number on the top right of ZED Explorer window.
